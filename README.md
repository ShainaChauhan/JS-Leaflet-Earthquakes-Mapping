# JS-Leaflet-Earthquakes-Mapping

As part of the Data Analytics Boot Camp at the University of Toronto, I've undertaken a project focusing on Earthquake Visualization. This project utilizes data sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), an organization tasked with offering scientific insights into natural hazards, ecosystem health, and the effects of climate and land-use changes. Through this endeavor, I aim to create a visualization that effectively communicates seismic activity data provided by the USGS, contributing to a better understanding of Earth's processes.
